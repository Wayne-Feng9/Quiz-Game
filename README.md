This is my first HTML CSS JS project
I made this for a school project
Enjoy!
(The background music kinda makes me nervous for some reason)

Credits:
How to Become a Developer (https://www.youtube.com/@howtobecomeadeveloper) - It gave me the tutorial that I followed to get the basic quiz game
Preston - He made the goofy ending music you hear when you finish the quiz
and finally...
Me - I added the rest of the code and music and other stuff
